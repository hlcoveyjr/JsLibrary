                "Want to apply for one of the technical jobs at LibraryThing?" +
                "Take the test below.If you can do it in under five minutes, let’s talk!" +
                "Background. I’ve been spending a lot of my time going through(read: “drowning in”) " +
                "applications for our 2 - 3 open technical jobs.And I’ve been conducting a few interviews. " +
                "The latter has demonstrated to me again the value of asking applicants to write code, especially simple code, " +
                "during the interviews.That interviews should involve simple code is now common wisdom in programming circles. " +
                "The story is that a high percentage of programmers, even people with impressive resumes, “just can’t code.” " +
                "Asked to do the simplest things—problems a good coders could solve as fast they could write—some spend ten or " +
                "twenty minutes before they get an answer, or fail entirely. (See discussion by Jeff Attwood and Joel Spolsky.) " +
                "I don’t go as far as others here. I think a lot of “slow coders” are probably excellent employees, making up for it " +
                "in other areas.Some projects don’t need speed.Some people just need to spend more time programming; " +
                "everyone was a slow programmer some time.But I know from experience that slow coders don’t work at LibraryThing. " +
                "They don’t fit the LibraryThing development culture.“Simple code” is critical.When I first started interviewing " +
                "I’d ask people to solve hard problems.This didn’t work.As Spolsky’s famous “The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing” argues, " +
                "however, simple problems are just as good, or better.Simple problems test simple skills, and simple skills are the " +
                "basis of complex ones.A programmer who struggles to loop through a bunch of words will be at sea performing far more complex tasks. " +
                "If you can’t boil water your Toad in the Hole is likely to come out wrong.";
